# Barometric Altimiter

## Summary

I'm planning on building a portable barometric altimiter which can either read a pressure altitude for a given barometric setting or display the current barometric setting. I was inspired to build this because I am currently in the process of becoming a pilot and I thought that this would be a cool way to expand my knowledge on coding and hardware whilst also paying tribute to my passion for aviation. This will be my first using hardware and I think it will be an exciting opportunity to learn new things.

## Plan

I will use a touchscreen LCD display as the main interface which allows the user to switch between reading an altitude or displaying the barometric setting. It will use a BMP280 I2C for barometric readings which will then be relayed onto the display.
